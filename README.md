## Tic-Tac-Toe

### Objective

Create a page with a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players can play against each other
keeping the score of the game after each round.

In this game you can choose the name of the players or just leave the default.

### Extra-Credits

If you play against the "Computer"(all you have to do is leave the default "Computer" as the
"O" player), you'll be playing against a miniMax algorithm, wich chooses the best play by recursively
going through the each players turn on the game until a terminal state is reached, then, it calculates
the best move by maximizing the score on the "computer" turn and minimizing on your turn.

#### Can you beat the Computer ???
